## **Project Overview**
The Google Play Store hosts millions of apps catering to various user needs. As of today, there are approximately **1.85 million** different apps available for download, with **2.56 million** apps accessible through the Play Store for Android users.

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) ** to uncover key insights, such as:
-  Identifying the **most popular app category**  
-  Finding the **app with the highest number of installs**  
-  Determining the **app with the largest size**  

## **Dataset Overview**

- ðŸ“Œ Contains information on **app categories, ratings, reviews, size, price, installs, and more**  
- ðŸ“Œ Data is sourced from the **Google Play Store**  

## **Steps We Are Going to Follow**
To ensure a structured and effective analysis, we will follow these three key steps:

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Data Cleaning**
   - Handling **missing values**  
   - Identifying and **removing duplicates**  
   - Correcting **data types**  
   - Standardizing **values and formats**  

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding **data distributions**  
   - Finding insights using **visualizations**  
   - Identifying **correlations and patterns**  
   - Determining **outliers and anomalies**
